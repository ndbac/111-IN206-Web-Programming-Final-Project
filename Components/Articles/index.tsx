            If you've ever stayed in Hanoi over Tet holiday—Lunar New Year—you
            know this: it's desolate.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-6 text-lg">
            Most people leave the city over this break, which usually happens
            from late January to mid February, and can last around two weeks for
            schools; businesses may only take one. Locals often go to visit
            relatives living in the provinces, and foreign workers like to take
            this time to travel. All of this leaves the city a bit of a ghost
            town. Most shops are closed, so you might even want to have some
            food stored up, and plenty of cash, as ATMs often run out of money.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-6 text-lg">
            But rather than resort to paranoia, you can see this instead as a
            time to have the city to yourself—a rare experience given its usual
            crowded state. And not everything will be closed. Here's a list of
            seven places to go in Hanoi over Tet.

          <p className="mt-6 text-lg">
            One of the cultural activities that the city provides is a firework
            display. This takes place over Hoan Kiem Lake. If visiting the lake,
            be wary of your possessions. It gets very crowded. Another
            alternative to viewing the fireworks is from a rooftop. You can try
            hotels in the area with rooftop terraces to get a comfortable view
            of the show.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-6 text-lg">
            According to legend, in early 1428, Emperor Lê Lợi was given a
            magical sword by the Golden Turtle God (Kim Qui) to smite the
            Chinese Ming Dynasty. After successfully fending off the invaders,
            the Emperor was boating on Hoàn Kiếm Lake when a giant turtle rose
            up and snatched the sword before diving back into the depths, never
            to be found again. Lê Lợi concluded that Kim Qui had come to reclaim
            the sword that its master, the Dragon King (Long Vương) had gifted
            him for the battle. The Emperor renamed the lake Hoàn Kiếm (“Lake of
            the Returned Sword”) to commemorate this event.

            Temple of Literature one of the most important monuments in Hanoi.

            In 1076, his son established the Imperial Academy as a royal school
            for only members of the elite such as princes, nobles, and
            bureaucrats. The Imperial Academy, which was considered as the first
            university in Vietnam, opened for about 700 years and educated
            hundreds of well-known scholars and mandarins. Despite continuous
            wars and disasters, the Temple of Literature remained its precious
            architectural and cultural value.

            Covering an area of over 54000 square meters, Temple of Literature,
            which is surrounded by an ancient brick wall, consists of five
            courtyards in different styles. The whole area consists of several
            main parts, which are described below.

            Located to the south of the Imperial Citadel of Thang Long, Temple
            of Literature was founded in 1070, almost 1000 years ago, by Emperor
            Ly Thanh Tong as a temple to worship the Chinese philosopher
            Confucius.

            Ho Chi Minh museum building is a bevelled square, nearly 20m high,
            each side measuring 70m in length, symbolizing an elegant white
            lotus flower. Four square blocks on the top floor are both lotus
            leaves. With an area of 18,000 m2, Ho Chi Minh Museum is the largest
            and most modern museum in the country.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-6 text-lg">
            In terms of content, Ho Chi Minh Museum represents the life and
            revolutionary career of President Ho Chi Minh associated with the
            nation and the era. On display solutions, the museum combines
            harmony with architecture, art and technology. The exhibition area
            of the museum is nearly 4,000 m2, presenting more than 2,000
            documents, artifacts, images reflecting the life and career of
            President Ho Chi Minh, attaching the important historical events of
            Vietnam from the late nineteenth century to the present.

            Also worth a visit is the stilt house, once home to Ho Chi Minh,
            which is excellently preserved, and the One Pillar Pagoda. This
            pagoda is a reconstruction of the original 11th century temple,
            which was destroyed by French colonial troops.

            When is the best time to visit Hanoi?
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-6 text-lg">
            Located in the north of the country, Hanoi actually enjoys a "cold"
            season, when temperatures drop into the teens.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-6 text-lg">
            With changes in humidity and sometimes strong winds coming from the
            river, nights can feel chilly in Hanoi in the months between
            November to February. This is usually the best time to visit Vietnam
            in general, as the weather is dry and pleasant, ideal for long walks
            around Hoan Kiem Lake and the narrow alleyways of Old Town Quarter.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-6 text-lg">
            If you'd rather experience warmer days, March, April, and October
            are good options as well. You'll get plenty of sunshine,
            temperatures in the high 20s, and a more bearable level of humidity
            - you'll also see higher prices, as these are popular months to
            visit Hanoi.
